                        <h3>What is Strands Game?</h3>
                        <p>
Strands is a new puzzle game. It is a word search game with a unique twist. In Strands, players are presented with a 6-by-8 grid of letters, and the objective is to find theme words that have something in common.
</p>

                        <p>Here are the legal words of the Strands game presented in bullet points:</p>
<span>1</span> Legal words in Strands must be at least four letters long.

<br>
<span>2</span> No three-letter words are allowed in the game.

<br>
<span>3</span> When connecting letters, players can move in any direction—up, down, left, right, or diagonally.

<br>
<span>4</span> Diagonals are considered legal moves in Strands.

<br>
<span>5</span> The arrangement of letters on the board won't typically form a straight line, featuring twists and turns.

<br>
<span>6</span> Repeated letters are allowed across different words; for instance, spelling "COMMA" will have two M's next to each other.

<br>
<span>7</span> This differs from games like Spelling Bee, where tapping the same letter twice is permitted.

                        <h3>What are Hints in Strands Game?</h3>
                        <p>The hint button in Strands is a smart feature! Instead of giving you an easy way to give up or cheat, hints are integrated into the game. To earn hints, you need to guess valid but incorrect words. The more challenging the game, the more hints you'll accumulate. Here's how to earn hints.
</p><p>If you discover a dictionary word that isn't part of the solution, your hints button will fill up. For instance, in the punctuation puzzle, highlighting a word like "SOLO" (unrelated to punctuation) will gradually fill the grayed-out Hint button, acting like a progress bar. Three off-target words earn you one hint.

                        <h3>How to use hints in Strands?</h3>
                        <p>Once your hint button is full, press it. One of the words you're looking for will be circled with dashed lines around its letters. This shows where the word is and its letters, but you still need to connect them correctly. The dashed-circle highlight stays until you solve that word. You can solve other words first, but you can't use additional hints until you solve the one the hint pointed to.

                        <p>In Strands, the emojis at the end tell you how you did. Blue means you found a regular word, yellow means you found the spangram, and a lightbulb means you used a hint.
